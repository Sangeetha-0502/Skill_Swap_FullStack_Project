# Skill_Swap_FullStack_Project
I have developed a full functional web based  full stack application where users can swap their skill with the other peer who matches his skill set.
The core idea of the project is user can register/login through their mail id and create account on this platform and they can enter their skill which is categorized in two ways which are the skills they want to learn and the sklls they can teach 
The user can swap their skill with who wants to learn the skill they provide and ready to offer the skill they want.
I have implemented the features such as user register and user login, finding match, verifying the profile wihth the linkedIn and github urls and certificaiton amd sending the connection request to the matched user.
