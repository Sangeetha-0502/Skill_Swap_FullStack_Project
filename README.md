Skill_Swap_FullStack_Project
I have developed a full functional web based full stack application where users can swap their skill with the other peer who matches his skill set. 
The core idea of the project is user can register/login through their mail id and create account on this platform and they can enter their skill which is categorized in two ways which are the skills they want to learn and the skills they can teach. 
The user can swap their skill with who wants to learn the skill they provide and ready to offer the skill they want. 
I have implemented the features such as user register and user login, finding match, verifying the profile wihth the linkedIn and github urls and certificaiton amd sending the connection request to the matched user.
This special is special to me as i designed and implemented it from scratch the every design and the way the features are implemented was fully designed and planned by myself
Learnings from this project : Connecting frontend with backend when they are running in diffrent ports, efficient database design, writing clean code and organizing, fixing bugs by debugging and lot more.
